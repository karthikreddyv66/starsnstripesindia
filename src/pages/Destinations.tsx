              Pench Tiger Reserve became India's first Dark Sky Park in January 2024, a recognition tied to successful efforts to reduce light pollution and improve the quality of the night sky. The reserve supports high-density tiger habitat and offers a dramatic natural setting of forest, meadows, and open clearings that can work beautifully for star trails, wide-field nightscapes, twilight landscapes, and environmental wildlife imagery.

              Tadoba-Andhari is widely recognized by wildlife photography operators as one of the best destinations in India for Bengal tiger safaris, with strong additional chances for leopard, dhole (Indian wild dog), sloth bear, and Indian gaur. Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve is also home to up to 250 bird species, featuring a dense concentration of wetland birds, waterfowl, and vibrant forest species that cluster around its prominent permanent lakes during the dry season including the Oriental Darter, Black-naped Monarch, Tickell's Blue Flycatcher, Pheasant-tailed Jacana, Black-hooded Oriole, Crested Treeswift, and the endangered Lesser Adjutant Stork around its deep woodland lakes. April is the best season for animal and bird encounters due to the dry conditions, especially around water sources and in open habitat at dawn and dusk.

              Five nights at Tadoba-Andhari, with a mix of full-day and half-day safaris across four days: 6 safaris totaling 40 hours in the field, including two full 12-hour days — the same format used by leading international tiger-photography operators — with Himanshu and Srini rotating between vehicles throughout.
