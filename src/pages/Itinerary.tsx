          Arrive at Nagpur Airport (NAG) by 9:30 AM or earlier (we can arrange room(s) at the Radisson Blu Hotel, 2 miles from Nagpur airport, at an extra charge, if you plan to arrive the previous day). We'll meet the group in the lobby of the Radisson Blu post breakfast at 1000 AM and drive roughly 2.5–3 hours to our jungle lodge on the edge of Pench Tiger Reserve. Lunch is served on arrival at the lodge. After settling in, we will hold a welcome briefing and full gear review — camera settings, lens choice for wildlife vs. astro, and a look at the week's weather and moon phase. First group dinner in the evening.

          Rest in the morning. After a relaxed morning and lunch, we leave the lodge around 2:30 PM for the day's wildlife safari with Himanshu and Srini into the core reserve zone, tracking tigers, leopards, bears, and Indian gaur, among others, along forest trails and waterholes. We return to the lodge by around 7 PM for dinner. We leave around 9 PM after dinner for the 45-minute drive to Pench's main dark-sky observation site for the day's astrophotography session with Abhishek, returning around 2–3 AM. On April 7 and 8, between 11:30 AM and 1:00 PM, for interested guests, we will have sessions at the lodge reviewing photos, going over post-processing techniques in Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop, and discussing all things photography.

No safari today on either end of the journey — a rest day for gear, memory card backups, and recovery from the late Pench nights. We arrive at our Tadoba lodge in the afternoon, settle in, and have dinner and rest, ready for the first full safari day tomorrow.

These days run across 4 vehicles — a comfortable two guests per vehicle — with Himanshu and Srini rotating between vehicles through the day.

        Today is a long 12-hour full-day safari, maximizing time in the field across the full arc of daylight, from first light through the midday lull and into evening color. We enter the park at dawn and remain inside until dusk, with a packed lunch and plenty of snacks, tea, and coffee provided in the park throughout the day. Park regulations limit full-day safaris to 3 vehicles; co-directors Himanshu and Srini rotate between vehicles to ensure every guest gets direct time with both.

              April 6, 2027 is new moon day, guaranteeing the darkest possible skies for our four nights of astrophotography on the tour. The first session (April 5) takes place at the lodge's own dedicated astrophotography space, a short walk from your room — an easy introduction on arrival night. The remaining three sessions (April 6–8) move to Pench's main dark-sky observation site, roughly a 45-minute drive from the lodge, in the heart of the area recognized as India's first Dark Sky Park in January 2024.

              The Milky Way, including the galactic core, is visible for approximately five hours on clear nights, moving from a low horizon approximately 5-degree arch before midnight to a high vertical approximately 70-degree position in the pre-dawn hours — giving photographers strong options for both wide panoramas and vertical compositions across the course of a night's session.
