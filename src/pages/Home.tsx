              This 10-day India photography tour combines two extraordinary experiences in one seamless itinerary — the inaugural edition of what we intend to run as a recurring expedition. Two of the most compelling subjects in nature photography in one trip: dark-sky astrophotography and Bengal tiger wildlife photography. The journey opens in the pristine, internationally certified dark skies of Pench National Park, which was designated India's first Dark Sky Park in January 2024 with developed stargazing infrastructure including observatory facilities. Pench is a rare setting for night-sky photography inside a tiger landscape. The second half moves to Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve, one of central India's best-known tiger destinations, where photographers work from safari vehicles in search of Bengal tigers and other wildlife during the best light of the day.

            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-10" style={{ color: '#3D4F60' }}>
              Built for photographers of all levels, this journey balances instruction, comfort, and field time. The tone of the trip is luxury in accommodation, expedition-style in wildlife experience, and educational in photography guidance.

Set among forest, meadows and open clearings, Pench pairs a rare, internationally certified dark sky with a genuine tiger landscape — a setting built for star trails, wide-field nightscapes, twilight landscapes, and environmental wildlife imagery, all without leaving the reserve.

                    Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve is Maharashtra's oldest and largest national park, and one of India's most tiger-dense reserves — a mosaic of dry deciduous forest, teak groves and shimmering lakes where sightings of the Bengal tiger are among the most reliable in the world. Its remote buffer villages sit far from major light pollution, and April's dry season draws animals to shrinking waterholes, making this the peak window for tiger encounters in central India, with a mix of full-day and half-day safaris to maximize your time in the field.

                <strong>This expedition is built around vehicle-based safaris</strong> — you'll spend your days seated in an open 4x4, not on foot, so there's no hiking fitness required to take part. Nights are spent at accessible, flat viewpoints for astrophotography, generally a short walk from the vehicle.

                If you've been hesitant about a wildlife trip because of physically demanding treks, or you've wanted to try astrophotography but didn't know where to start, this tour is designed for exactly that.

              <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed" style={{ color: '#4A5568' }}>
                Safaris run early morning and late afternoon to match the best light and highest tiger activity — with two full-day safaris in Tadoba for those who want maximum time in the field — and nights (when clear) run late for star photography, so days can be long. A basic level of alertness and flexibility around an early-and-late schedule will help you enjoy it fully.

                  Note: Tadoba sits at low elevation, so there is no concern about altitude sickness on this trip.
